RareShare Addon for World of Warcraft
=========

RareShare receives and shares information on the locations and current HP of rare mobs both on The Timeless Isle and across the rest of Azeroth and Outland.

- Detects targetting and health changes of rares
- Detects deaths of rares via combat log
- Announces discovery (and death) of rare mobs in General chat for people not using RareShare
- Plays a "ding!" upon discovery of a rare
- If the [TomTom](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/tomtom) addon is found, creates a TomTom waypoint for any discovered rare, keeping the location up-to-date as the mob moves
- Displays the current HP of the rare in the TomTom waypoint for convenience
- Shares all data with other RareShare users
- Parses messages from the RareCoordinator addon
