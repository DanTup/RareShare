RareShare Addon for World of Warcraft
=========

RareShare receives and shares information on the locations and current HP of rare mobs both on The Timeless Isle and across the rest of Azeroth and Outland.

Features
===

- Detects rare mobs when targetted
- Detects rare mobs when mouse is rolled over them
- Detects health changes of rares
- Detects deaths of rares via combat log
- Announces discovery (and death) of rare mobs in General chat for people not using RareShare (this can be disabled with '/rs announce')
- Suppresses announcements/waypoints for Evermaw at 100% health, since this seems to be a *lot* of the time (this can be disabled with '/rs evermaw')
- Only announces rares with >= 50% health in chat, to avoid alerting people to rares they probably can't reach (people using RareShare will still get sounds and waypoints for all rares)
- Plays a "ding!" upon discovery of a rare (this can be disabled with '/rs sounds')
- If the [TomTom](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/tomtom) addon is found, creates a TomTom waypoint for any discovered rare, keeping the location up-to-date as the mob moves (this can be disabled with '/rs tomtom')
- Displays the current HP of the rare in the TomTom waypoint for convenience
- Shares all data with other RareShare users
- Parses messages from RareCoordinator users (you do *not* need RareCoordinator installed)
- All settings (sounds, announcements, tomtom, evermaw) persist across logins and are shared by all characters

Installation
===

1. Install [RareShare](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/rareshare)
2. (Optional; but recommended) Install [TomTom](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/tomtom)
3. That's it! RareShare will automatically find and announce rares, including parsing RareCoordinator messages (you do *not* need RareCoordinator installed for this to work)
